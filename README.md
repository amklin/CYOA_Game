## Game Description

The player is a demigod in their early youth, eager to prove themself. Stuck within a labyrinth, the player awaits imminent assaults from half a dozen monsters (inspired by the Labors of Hercules), and they must defeat them all in order to collect the keys and be bestowed with the elixir of immortality. The player can move around the labyrinth and enter different rooms scattered throughout the labyrinth's perimeter. User inputs can dictate a variety of tasks, such as: (1) picking up weapons, (2) retaliating the monsterâ€™s attacks, (3) opening locked doors, (4) lighting up dark regions, and (5) picking up and collecting items.
